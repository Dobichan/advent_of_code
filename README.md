## My Advent of Code explorations

Advent of Code is an annual programming competition that takes place in December.
Each day, a new coding challenge is released, and participants can solve the problems in any programming language.
The event is designed to be fun and educational, providing a great way to improve coding skills and engage with a global community of developers.
For more information, visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

This repository contains the attempts I have done to solve the challenges. For educational purposes I might use several programming languages
solutions and libraries to solve the tasks.
